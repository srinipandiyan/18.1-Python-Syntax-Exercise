In this exercise, you’ll practice using the interactive Python interpreter, running Python scripts, and using Python’s syntax.

## **Step One: Working in Python Files**

For all the syntax challenges, do your work in script files (Python files normally end with ***.py***). We’ve provided a starter file for each of these with the problem statement and simple print-style tests already.

- ***count_up.py***
- ***in_range.py***
- ***sum.py***
- ***any7.py***
- ***convert.py***

You can run a Python script in one of two ways:

1. When you’re already in IPython, you can run a script with `%run myscript.py`. This runs your script and leaves you in IPython, where you can examine variables, run functions, etc, from your script. **This is often the best way to try things out.**
2. From the shell, you can run your script as `python3 myscript.py`

## **Step Two: Starting On Your Own**

Do this work in a new file, ***words.py***.

1. For a list of words, print out each word on a separate line, but in all uppercase. How can you change a word to uppercase? Ask Python for help on what you can do with strings!
2. Turn that into a function, ***print_upper_words***. Test it out. (Don’t forget to add a docstring to your function!)
3. Change that function so that it only prints words that start with the letter ‘e’ (either upper or lowercase).
4. Make your function more general: you should be able to pass in a set of letters, and it only prints words that start with one of those letters.
    
    For example:
